#### Question 2

You are given a box of crayons with different colors represented by different alphabets. In one operation, you can remove several continuous crayons of the same color. You may perform this operation several times until the box is empty. Each time you can choose the crayon set, they must be continous and of the same color (i.e., set of *x* crayons, *x* >= 1). After removing them, you will get  *x*x* points.

You are given an integer *N* where *N* denotes the total number of crayons in the box. You are also given an array *colors* denoting the *N* colors in the box where each color is represented by an English Alphabet.
