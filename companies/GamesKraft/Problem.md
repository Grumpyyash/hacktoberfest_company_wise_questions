#### Question 1

Julia has two arrays of long integers, a and b. For each pair of integers (a[i], b[i]) she wants to find the lowest value of x that is a non-negative integer solution (x,y) for the following equations:

- x + y = a_i
- x ^ y = b_i

The symbol ^ denotes the bitwise XOR operator. Once we have determined (x,y), store the value of 2*x + 3 *y to your return array.
